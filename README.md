<h1>Beat Maker Overview</h1>
 <p>Choose a room to build a beat. Rooms are based on music genres, so each room will have different instruments and tempos to set the tone respectively. To hear a loop of an instrument, click around the room on different objects, which may or may not be the actual representation of the sound(e.g. A chair when clicked plays a loop an electrical piano). No need to wait for the next bar to add another loop, just click it whenever and the beat maker will synchronize it to the loops that are currently playing.</p> 
 After you familiarize yourself with the sounds go ahead and record your beat by pressing the record button. Note recordings will terminate after 4 minutes if you don't stop it. Once recording is finished, an mp3 of your beat will be available for download. !!!Enjoy:):)

- Weekend
  - finish room layout. 
  - Make objects in the room play a loop when clicked. 
  - Synch up all the clicks so nothing plays off beat. 
  - Get most of the page built with functional clickable objects.  
- Monday
  - Make a record button that allows users to record while turning on and off sounds. 
  - Don't let the recording exceed 4 minutes. 
  - Show the recording back to the user. 
- Tuesday
  - make an Mp3 of the beat available for download after the recording finishes. 
  - Work on styling the page
- Wednesday
  - (bonus) Have the room start off with dull colors like black and white. 
  - Every time an object that has a loop is clicked a section of the room will fill with color
- Thursday
  - Rewrite this readMe as a production readMe
  - Deploy to Github page
